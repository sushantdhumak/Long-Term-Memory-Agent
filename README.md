- Classifies incoming messages (respond, ignore, notify)
- Drafts responses
- Schedules meetings

# Email Assistant with Semantic Memory + Episodic Memory

Let's create an Email Assistant that:
- Classifies incoming messages (respond, ignore, notify)
- Drafts responses
- Schedules meetings
- Uses memory to remember details from previous emails

Now, we'll add human-in-the-loop following the triage step to better refine the assistant's ability to classify emails
